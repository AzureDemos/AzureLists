# Example 103 - App Services with Table Storage
1 July 2018

In this example we have switched the Azure SQL DB for Azure Table Storage, a NoSQL key-value store designed for rapid development using massive semi-structured datasets.
Table storage is very affordable and enables you to store petabytes of data and scale without having to manually shard your dataset. 
Itâ€™s geo-redundant storage is replicated across regions and embraces a strong consistency model, ensuring all users accessing the data will always see the latest update.

> NOTE - this example covers the topic of Azure Table Storage as the data store. Information on Azure App Service, performance monitoring using Application Insights, the website user interface, setup/deployment and the general design choices such as MVC or SPA's can be found in the [101 example](https://azurelists.azurewebsites.net/architectures/app-services-with-sql-db).

Key Features | Azure Table Storage
-- | --	
Data | Flexible data schema, with OData-based queries
Scaling |  Store petabytes of semi-structured data
Cosmos |  Azure Cosmos DB Table API is a premium offering for table storage that offers throughput-optimized tables, global distribution, and automatic secondary indexes
Redundancy | Geo-Redundant storage, stored data is replicated three times within a region, and an additional three times in another region hundreds of miles away
Consistency | Embraces a strong consistency model. Handles systems with multiple users who are updating data stores simultaneously.
Price | Table storage is the cheapest of the three data stores
