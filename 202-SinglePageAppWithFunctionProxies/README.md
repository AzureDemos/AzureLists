# Example 202 - Single Page Application with Function Proxies
20 July 2018

In the example we have re-written the website in Angular and TypeScript using Visual Studio Code and the Angular CLI. Single-Page Applications (SPAs) are Web apps that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app. Not only does this give a great user experience but by combining this with Azure Function Proxies, we can host the website at a fraction of the cost.
