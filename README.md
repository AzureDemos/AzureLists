# AzureLists

## OUR GOAL - TO DEMONSTRATE HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF AZURE
Azure has hundreds of services to offer from compute, networking and storage, through to data, analytics and machine learning. Choosing the right product for you, when building or hosting applications can become a tricky task (pun intended). We aim to build a real application, showcasing the different products available, with live demos and code examples.

Itâ€™s a task list application, much like Wunderlist, but without all the bells and whistles. You can create lists and assign tasks to your lists with due dates and notes. Then mark them as complete when your done.

Each example demonstrates a different way in which the same application can be built, deployed, hosted and scaled. Finally looking into productionising the application by implementing security, identity, monitoring and reporting.
