# AzureLists

Azure has hundreds of services to offer from **compute, networking and storage**, through to **data, analytics and machine learning**. Choosing the right product for you, when building or hosting applications can become a tricky task (pun intended). We aim showcase the different products available, with live demos and code examples.

We've build a task list application, much like [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com), but without all the bells and whistles. You can create lists and assign tasks to your lists with due dates and notes. Then mark them as complete when your done.

The app is simple by design, our goal is to show how Azure cloud technolgies can be used and fit together, not to get bogged down in the complexities of the application domain.

Each example demonstrates a different way in which the same application can be built, deployed, hosted and scaled. Finally looking into productionising the application by implementing security, identity, monitoring and reporting.

## User Interface and Features

## Try it out Yourself
A working demo of the application features can be found at [http://demo.azurelists.com](http://demo.azurelists.com). The contents of the demo site are reset periodically.

## Archecture Components
Each example will demonstrate how to build and host the application using various cloud technologies, but three main compontents will always remain constant.

## Domain
Due to the simplicity of the application and the focus being on the technology rather than the core functionality, we are not covering topics such as domain analyis or indentitifcation of service boundaries.

Most examples will include just two models (List and Task), but as we progress into areas such as Identity, we may add a third one for users

## The Architectures we will cover
We will focus 10 subject areas. Each subject area will have example architectures and code examples hosted on our GitHub.

1. Enterprise PaaS offerings for Apps and Data 
2. Serverless Computing
3. Microservice Orchestrators
4. Enterprise Integrations and Low Code Applications
5. Event Driven Architectures
6. Artificial Intelligence
7. Mobile Apps
8. Dev Ops
9. Security
10. Reporting
